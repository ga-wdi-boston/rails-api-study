# Rails as an API Study

Rails is a popular back-end framework with an MVC architecture. Traditionally,
Rails was responsible for all parts of your web application, including building
and send HTML responses. Sending HTML responses is the "view" layer's
responsibility.

In this program, we use Rails as an API, which means we won't be using the view
layer. Instead, we'll use models and controllers and build and send JSON
responses to incoming web requests.

## Prerequisites

-   [ga-wdi-boston/http-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/http-study)
-   [ga-wdi-boston/json-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/json-study)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Define the responsibilities of the model layer in Rails.
-   Define the responsibilities of the controller layer in Rails.
-   Define the responsibilities of the router in Rails.
-   Diagram how a Rails API responds to a web request.
